## :book: About

## **NoEyeTest** is a script designed for the browser-game: [BBGM](http://www.basketball-gm.com); The intention the script is to create a realistic progression system by using simple formulas based on player's PER stat for the last season

## :question: Why was this made?

By default in BBGM, at the age of 26, a player will have a great chance to regress that only gets higher and worse the more they age; Within one off-season, an elite player(s) on your team could be devastatingly weakened or some players that should be hitting their prime, do not. The motive behind this is to enable a system that reasonably progresses players while not being based on random chance. This prog script is especially beneficial to multiplayer BBGM leagues, which, if you are familiar with, you know how critical progs are for a team.

-   This script will now take affect on players at 25; 1 year early and removing that normal BBGM Prog from them.

### :brain: Logic Behind the Script

By taking into account the player's PER:

-   We create a reference point for you to be informed of the potential 'Prog Range' of your player
-   Confidence in knowing your player will progress based on their performance. This means your all-star player who is coming off an amazing season, 19.50 PER will have a great chance to prog well, instead of randomly going -7.
